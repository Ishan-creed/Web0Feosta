And, it requires balanced integration of the instinctual, emotional, mental and spiritual aspects of knowing. Every single person on the planet has a story. Don’t judge people before you truly know them. The truth might surprise you.If you do something wrong, then accept it. Denying wrongdoings will never give you self-respect.There is a limit to intelligence, but no limit to foolishness.</p></div>
